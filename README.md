How to Play?

You play this game by first logging into your account. When you login you can change your password, see how many games you have played, start a new game or logout.


Planning

I wrote out my HTML first, created a simple tic tac toe board to which event listeners can be added. After which, I created the game engin the game would run on. After the game engin has been figured out, I would add in the API for the login, change password, create a new user, get game, and upload the score to the API. After all has been done and confirmed working, I would add in the CSS for the website.

Problem solving
- Utilizing console.log with every action to determin what each function is putting.
- Utilizing documentation on methods to find different ways of using it in my application.
- Breaking down large issues into more managable issues and solving each one before moving on.
- Constantly commiting changes, so when I mess up, I had a clear commit history to refer back to when lost.
- Created several empty dives in the index HTML to delete and add objects as needed by the current state of the webpage.
