How to Play?

You play this game by first logging into your account. When you login you can change your password, see how many games you have played, start a new game or logout.


Planning

I wrote out my HTML first, created a simple tic tac toe board to which event listeners can be added. After which, I created the game engin the game would run on. After the game engin has been figured out, I would add in the API for the login, change password, create a new user, get game, and upload the score to the API. After all has been done and confirmed working, I would add in the CSS for the website.

Problem solving
- Utilizing console.log with every action to determin what each function is putting.
- Utilizing documentation on methods to find different ways of using it in my application.
- Breaking down large issues into more managable issues and solving each one before moving on.
- Constantly commiting changes, so when I mess up, I had a clear commit history to refer back to when lost.
- Created several empty dives in the index HTML to delete and add objects as needed by the current state of the webpage.

Adding Features
- Given more time, I would like to work more on my CSS. Making the website look more modern.
- Adding the option of having two palyers loggin in at once so each player can log his/her own move
- Have a mobile friendly website. My current website can't be displayed correctly on a mobile.


Development Process
I followed my plan pretty well. The onlything that I did not follow was I ended up adding in the API first before finishing my game engin. The reason being that my game engin wasnt outputting the format the the API required it to be. So I ended up scrapping my game engin, implemented the API to ensure what my game engin generates can be used by the API. This was the main obstical that I ran into while mfinishing this project.
